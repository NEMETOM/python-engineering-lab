# Python Engineering Lab

A curated collection of production-style Python mini-projects demonstrating:

- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Behavior-driven development (BDD)
- CI/CD quality gates
- Compliance automation
- Structured logging & observability
- Policy-as-code principles

This repository showcases my transition from QA automation into platform-oriented engineering.
